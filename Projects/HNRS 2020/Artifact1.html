        <p >For my first artifact I chose a the ticket for an opera that I went to wirth my friends
            it the opera was put on by the <strong>Toledo Opera</strong> in the 
            <strong><font color="#ff7452">Valentine Theater</font></strong>

        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <p><strong> Now you may ask "Why the opera"</strong></p>

        <br> <br>

        <p><font color="white">Well, one night in November my roomate and I were sitting around
            playing a game together and he said to me "Why don't we go to the opera." Now he was obviously
            joking but it got me thinking. Why don't we go to the opera. So, I went to the website and before I thought too hard on it
            I purchased three tickets at an eye watering price (<font color="green">$130</font>) 
            for an opera that was happening 3 months from now. It was a bit of an
            impulse buy, yet it gave me more to look forward to than most other online purchases I made on a whim.
        </font></p>

        <br> <br>

        <p>
            So, finally the much anticipated day comes to go to the opera
            and oh boy were we pumped. We dressed in our <strong><font color="pink">finest silks</font></strong>, and donned our most <strong><font color="#09f3ff">affluent jewels</font></strong>
            we began the drive to Toledo. When we get there we are greeted by the person who checks your tickets
            and she asks is this your first opera. We say yes and her face instantly lights up and she begins
            to start to list some fun facts and other things of that sort. Well at the end she asks are you guys performing arts
            or music students, and my roomate instantly responds no we just thought it would be fun to go to the opera.
            But this gets us thinking what if we were music students. So, anytime anyone asks us if we are music students 
            (everyone asks this) we'll just say yes make up our own personal view of what we would be if we were music majors.
            My friend he's studying the ins and outs of the cello (he used to play the cello in middle school), my roomate is 
            majoring in music production (he has a pirated copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FL_Studio" target="_blank">FL Studio</a>), 
            and I specialize in the tuba (I once got a II on a grade C tuba solo as a sophomore in high school).
            Now while this is a <strong><font color="red">bold faced lie</font></strong> nobody is getting hurt and the older people we spoke to seemed happy to see
            music students getting involved with opera as a medium.
            So we chat with a few people in our new personas before eventually sitting down in our assigned seats and getting ready to enjoy
            the opera. Now we had the <strong><font color="gold">best</font></strong> seats in the house all the way at the tippy top of the theater 
            (the seats furthest from the stage). Finally, the months of waiting were over it was time to watch the opera. What struck me first was the whole thing turned 
            out to be sung in French.
            I sadly can't speak french so I was a little worried having not read Romeo and Juliet in school (Covid's effects are still visibile even now). 
            I thought I may not be able to comprehend their act but, I am happy to say that the idea of two lovers who cannot be together
            is a myth that is as common as butter on toast.
            Not to say that my friends and I weren't enjoying the graceful sopranos 
            (<strong>the high notes of the actress that played Juliet were incredible</strong>) and the powerful baritones 
            (sorry to say Romeo was a tenor so he didn't stand out quite as much to me)
            but it was clear that we were in no mood to stay for the rest of the performance.

        <p>
            Like celebrities trying to make and exit after being spotted by the papparazzi, we gathered our things and headed for the front door.
            Hoping to not appear as uncultured swine unable, we forwent putting on our coats in an attempt to make it
            seem like we were just going out to our car to grab a forgotten item. After fooling the other, stronger willed patron, we
            piled into my friends dilapidated <strong><font color="blue">2006 Honda Civic</font></strong>
            and met with our friends who live in Toledo for some food. It was only 9pm-ish at this point, not wanting to waste a day off we wen't back to 
            their apartment. The plan initally was to just stay for an hour, maybe two, before heading back 
            to <strong><font color="#ff7452">BGSU</font></strong> but as the conversation was still lively we decided that we could stay for just one more
            hour. We kept saying this for each hour until we had reached 5am.</p>
        
        <br> <br>

        

        <p ><strong><font color="salmon"> While a fun tale in its own right. I find it
            exemplifies certain aspects of my own personal worldview. </font></strong></p>

        <br> <br>

        <p>
            Like most people, I am not a devout follower of one worldview, but rather a fine solution of several different perceptions on
            the way the world works. To begin with I believe with <strong><font color="#8803fc">living in the moment</font></strong>. 
            
            Some people would say that I'm short sighted, but unless they have been endowed with omnipotence,
            they are only able to see as far into the future as I can.
