        <p>For my first artifact I chose a the ticket for an opera that I went to wirth my friends
            it the opera was put on by the <strong>Toledo Opera</strong> in the 
            <strong><font color="#ff7452">Valentine Theater</font></strong>

        </p>

        <br> <br>
        

        <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

        <br> <br>
        <p style="background-color: #4d4d4d"><font color="white">Well, one night in November my roomate and I were sitting around
            playing a game together and he said to me "Why don't we go to the opera." Now he was obviously
            joking but it got me thinking. Why don't we go to the opera. So, I went to the website and went 
            and purchased three tickets (one for me, one for my roomate, and one for my friend) for the an opera that was showing 3 months from now. It was a bit of an
            impulse buy but I always was the kind of person to choose to live in the moment.

        <br>

        <br>

        <p style="background-color: #4d4d4d"><font color="white">So, finally the day came to go to the opera
            and oh boy were we pumped. We dressed in our <strong><font color="pink">finest silks</font></strong>, and donned in the our most <strong><font color="#09f3ff">affluent jewels</font></strong>
            we began the drive to Toledo. When we get there we are greeted by the person who checks your tickets
            and she asks is this your first opera. We say yes and her face instantly lights up and she begins
            to start to list some fun facts and other things of that sort. Well at the end she asks are you guys performing arts
            or music students, and my roomate instantly responds no we just thought it would be fun to go to the opera.
            But this gets us thing what if we were music students. So, anytime anyone asks us if we are music students 
            (everyone asks this) we'll just say yes make up our own personal view of what we would be if we were music majors.
            My friend he's studying the chello, my roomate is majoring in music production, and I specialize in the tuba.
            Now while this is a pretty <strong>bold faced lie</strong> nobody is getting hurt (no harm no fowl right).
            So we chat with a few people in our new personas before eventually sitting down in our assigned seats and getting ready to enjoy
            the opera. Now we had the <strong><font color="gold">best</font></strong> seats in the house all the way at the tippy top of the theater 
            (they were the cheapest seats you could get). The opera began and I have to say perhaps I should of done a little bit more research
            as it seems the whole thing was in french. Fast forward 2 hours and we are at the intermission. Not to say that my friends and I weren't
            enjoying the graceful sopranos and the powerful baritones but it was clear that we were in no mood to stay for the rest of the performance.
