        <p>For my first artifact I chose a the ticket for an opera that I went to wirth my friends
            it the opera was put on by the <strong>Toledo Opera</strong> in the 
            <strong><font color="#ff7452">Valentine Theater</font></strong>

        </p>

        <p style="background-color: #4d4d4d"><font color="white">Why? Well, one night in November my roomate and I were sitting around
            playing a game together and he said to me "Why don't we go to the opera." Now he was obviously
            joking but it got me thinking. Why don't we go to the opera. So, I went to the website and went 
            and purchased three tickets (one for me, one for my roomate, and one for my friend) for the an opera that was showing 3 months from now. It was a bit of an
            impulse buy but I always was the kind of person to choose to live in the moment.

        <p style="background-color: #4d4d4d"><font color="white">So, finally the day came to go to the opera
            and oh boy were we pumped. We dressed in our finest silks, and donned in the out most affluent jewels
