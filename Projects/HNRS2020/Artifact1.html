        <p >For my first artifact, I chose a ticket for an opera that I attended with my friends.
            The opera was a rendition of Romeo and Juliet put on by the <strong>Toledo Opera</strong> in the 
            <strong><font color="#ff7452">Valentine Theater</font></strong>.
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <p><strong><font color="#0f1bfc">"What's so special about this opera?"</font></strong>

        <br><br>

            Well, one night in November, my roommate and I were
            playing a game together, and all of a sudden he said, "We need to go to the opera." Now he was obviously
            joking, but it got me thinking. Why don't we go to the opera? So, I went to the website. and before 
            I thought too hard about it, I purchased three tickets at an eye-watering price (<font color="green">$130</font>) 
            for an opera that was happening three months from now. It was a bit of an
            impulse buy, yet it gave me more to look forward to than most other online purchases I made on a whim.

        <br><br>

            So, finally, the much anticipated day comes to go to the opera,
            and, oh boy, we were pumped. 
            We dressed in our <strong><font color="pink">finest silk</font></strong> and donned our most <strong><font color="#09f3ff">affluent jewels</font></strong>. 
            Then we began the drive to Toledo. Upon arrival, we are greeted by the ticket taker, 
            and she asks, "Is this your first opera?" We say yes, and her face instantly lights up. She begins by
            listing some fun facts about the theater and giving us a quick rundown of operas. Once she's done, she asks, "Are you guys performing arts
            or music students?" and my roommate instantly responds, "No, we just thought it would be fun to go to the opera."
            But this gets us thinking. What if we were music students? So, anytime anyone asks us if we are music students 
            (they always ask), we'll just say yes and make up whatever major we want.
            My friend is studying the ins and outs of the cello (he used to play the cello in middle school), my roommate is 
            majoring in music production (he has a pirated copy of 
            <a class="flstudio" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FL_Studio" style="margin: 5px 5px 0 -2px;" target="_blank">FL Studio<img src="Images/flstudio.png"></a>), 
            and I specialize in the tuba (I once got a II on a grade C tuba solo as a sophomore in high school).
            Now, while this is a <strong><font color="red">bold-faced lie</font></strong>, nobody is getting hurt, and the older people we spoke to seemed happy to see
            music students getting involved with opera as a medium.
            So we chat with a few people in our new personas before eventually sitting down in our assigned seats and getting ready to enjoy
            the opera. Now we had the <strong><font color="gold">best</font></strong> seats in the house all the way at the tippy top of the theater 
            (the seats furthest from the stage). Finally, the months of waiting were over, and it was time to watch the opera. 
            The first thing I learned about the opera was that it was entirely in French.
            I sadly can't speak French, so I was a little worried I may struggle to comprehend the story
            having not read Romeo and Juliet in school (Covid's effects are still visible even now). 
            I thought I may not be able to comprehend their act, but I am happy to say that stories with 
            two lovers who cannot be together are as common as butter on toast, so the story wasn't too hard to follow.
            Not to say that my friends and I weren't enjoying the graceful sopranos 
            (<strong>the high notes of the actress that played Juliet were incredible</strong>) and the powerful baritones 
            (sorry to say Romeo was a tenor, so he didn't stand out quite as much to me),
            but it was clear that we were in no mood to stay for the rest of the performance.

        <br><br>

            Hoping to not appear as the uncultured swine that the other patrons most likely already assumed we were, 
            we kept our coats in our hands in an attempt to appear like we were just going out for a short breath of fresh air
            before staying for the last half of the opera. 
            After making our way out of the building and past the group of people smoking out front of the main entrance, 
            we piled into a dilapidated <strong><font color="blue">2006 Honda Civic</font></strong> 
            and met with our friends who live in Toledo for some food. Since it was only around 9 p.m., we went back to 
            their apartment. The plan initially was to just stay for an hour, maybe two, before heading back 
            to <strong><font color="#ff7452">BGSU</font></strong>, but as the conversation was still lively, we decided that another hour couldn't hurt. 
            This, of course, led to us staying there for over 8 hours just talking.</p>
        
        <br><br>
        


        <p><strong><font color="salmon"> While this artifact is not something that changed the way I saw the world, I find it
            exemplifies certain aspects of my own personal worldview. </font></strong>

        <br><br>

            Like most people, I am not a devout follower of one worldview but rather a fine solution of several different perceptions of
            the way the world works. 

        <br><br>

            To begin with, I believe in <strong><font color="#8803fc">living in the moment</font></strong>.
            Some people may say that I'm shortsighted, but unless they have been endowed with omnipotence,
            they are only able to see as far into the future as I can.

        <br><br>
            
            This artifact also offers some insight into more implicit ways of viewing the world in terms of archetypes and myths.
            Something I noticed is that when I think of any given <strong><font color="#9e1b37">archetype</font></strong>, my mind will subconsciously 
            form the archetype in a way that I can see myself fitting into it. For example, when given the chance to be any kind of music 
            major, my brain automatically picks the one I could most see myself as. The same thing happens with
            <strong><font color="#1b499e">myth</font></strong>. When I am consuming any piece of art, I will instantly begin viewing it in relation to 
            other mythological stories that I know. Like Romeo and Juliet being something so engrained that despite
            a language barrier, the story was still something that I was able to understand.

        <br><br>
            Lastly, I don't really view events themselves as exciting, so much as I see events as a 
            vehicle to further <strong><font color="#f76f98">the connections that I have with other humans</font></strong>. In this artifact, I talked about
            the opera quite a bit and was genuinely excited for it, yet when I think about that night, I mostly 
            seem to remember my friends and the people that I interacted with.
